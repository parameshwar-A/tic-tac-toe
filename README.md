# Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to my **Tic-Tac-Toe** project!
First thanks for looking and spending time on my project.

Let's make things clear,
This is not the best Tic-Tac-Toe python project in the internet.
Also the code inside this project will not be a clean code or a optimized one.
Then why did I made this?

This project is made to keep me continuosly practice python in a daily basis during my full time college and internship works.
This project can be done in a single day, but I practiced only 10 minutes everyday so the project stretched about 2 weeks to finish it.

In future, I will optimize the code as the time goes on.

**If you want, you can fork it and update the changes.**

I am looking forward to see how my code can be changed, so feel free to add changes. 

**Happy coding**
